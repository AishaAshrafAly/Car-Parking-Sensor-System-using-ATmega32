# Car-Parking-Sensor-System-using-ATmega32
This project implements a car parking sensor system designed with the ATmega32 microcontroller, an ultrasonic sensor, a 16x2 LCD display, LEDs, and a buzzer. The system helps drivers detect obstacles while parking by measuring the distance to nearby objects and providing real-time visual and auditory alerts.
